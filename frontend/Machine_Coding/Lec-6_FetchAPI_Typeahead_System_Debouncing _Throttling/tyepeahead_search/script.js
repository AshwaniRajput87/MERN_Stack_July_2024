/***
  
  Typeahead system:

   - it is also know as auto suggesstion search box
   - when the user is typing something then you have to auto populate the list of data for end user -> help the end user to take some decision


    Must have feature:
     - input search box - using input tag and basic style
     - make a API call to fetch dynamic data while typing in the search box
     - populate the data inside ul list and display list of data.
     - ask for providing the end points or some default results.

   Good to have:
    - Sorting the data alphbatically
    - apply the deboucing to pause the request on every typing
    - if no data found then can display a message with no results found
