   What is Fetch API?

     - it is provided by the browser not the JS itself.
     - It helps devs to make API calls, so that dynamic data can be fetched from the server.
     - you use fetch() function -> returns a promise to resolve or reject the request, then after you have to consume the responses(success or failure response)

     - Syntax:
        fetch(url, [options]) - returns promise

     - to consume use, either then and catch or async await.
